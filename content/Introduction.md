## Prologue

At the request of my cousin Amalita Jordan and her daughter, Silvia Ruby,
who kindly provided me with a cassette recorder and cassettes, it is my
pleasure to record the few memories that I still possess of our Morales
Mollinedo family. I am adding a few anecdotes and customs that have
affected me during my more than eighty years of existence. Since I have
few literary skills, I pray that those who have the patience to read or
listen to my story will be kind in their judgments and comments. Thank you.
